      <li>$$\dot x = x^3-7x+6$$ 3 fixed points, \(x=1,2,-3\). 
        1 is stable, 2 and -3 are unstable.</li>
      <li> $$ \dot x = 3x^4 -2x^3 - 3 x^2 -1=f(x).$$
        To find fixed points, consider 
        $$f'(x)=12x^3-6x^2-6x=6x(2x^2-x-1)$$
        so there are three stationary points, at 
        x=0 (max), 1 (min), -1/2 (min),
        where \(f=-1, -3, -27/16\) so there are only two 
        fixed points, near -1 (stable) and 2 (unstable).
      <li> $$\dot x =e^x-x^3 =f(x). $$
      For \(x<0\) both terms are positive so there are 
        no fixed points there. \( f(0)=1, \ f(1)=e-1>0, \ 
        f(3)=e^3-3^3<0, \ f(5)>0 \). There are two fixed points. 
          The smaller one is stable, the larger one unstable.

    <li>The fixed points of 
    $$\dot x = 1+\cos x =f(x) $$
      are at \( x=\pi +2n\pi \). 
      Since \( f(x)>0 \) for all other x, 
      all solutions approach one of the fixed points as 
      \( t \to \infty\), even though all the fixed points are unstable. 
    </li>
  <p></p>
    <li>For the differential equation 
    $$\dot x = x^2-t, $$
      \( \dot x = 0\) on the curve \( t=x^2\) so the direction field has 
      horizontal line segments there. 
      Inside this parabolic curve \( x \) decreases. 
      For the initial condition \(x(0)=0\), 
      \(x\) decreases and approaches the curve 
      \(x(t) = -\sqrt{t} \) for large \(t\).
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
    <ol type="a" style="padding-left:20px">
      <li> $$ \dot x = x^2 - 5x +7  > 0 $$ so there are no
        fixed points and all solutions tend to infinity.
      <li> For $$ \dot x = -|x| $$ there is a fixed point at 0.
        Positive initial conditions approach this point. 
        Negative initial conditions approach -infinity. 
        We can't use the usual stability rule because the function is not differentiable, 
        but the fixed point is unstable.
      <li> Exact straight line solutions are \(x=0\) and \(x=1+t\).
        Near the first of these, solutions approach it for \(t>0\) so it can be regarded as stable.
        Near the other, solutions move away from it. 
        So all initial conditions below 1 approach 0, 
        and all solutions with initial condition greater than
        1 approach infinity.

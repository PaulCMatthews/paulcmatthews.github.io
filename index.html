<h1>Differential Equations, Bifurcations and Chaos</h1>
  
  
<p>This is the author website for the book 
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-99543-9" target="_blank">Differential Equations, Bifurcations and Chaos</a>,
  by Paul C. Matthews, 
  published by <a href="https://www.springer.com">Springer</a> in September 2025 as part of their 
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/series/3423" target="_blank">Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series</a>. </p>
<p>
  The book is aimed at undergraduate students in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Engineering. 
  Because of the broad target audience, it does not include formal mathematical proofs. 
  There are 235 pages, over 60 diagrams, many worked examples, and exercise at the end of each chapter.

<h1>Vector Calculus</h1>

<p>My book on Vector Calculus was <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-0597-8">published by Springer</a> in 1998. 
Note that the description on the Springer site that the author is a "young writer" may no longer be accurate. 
The book has a similar format and style to <a href="index.html">Differential Equations, Bifurcations and Chaos</a>, with over 60 figures, 
  worked examples, exercises, and summaries of key points at the end of each chapter. </p>

<p>Vector calculus provides a way to describe physical quantities in three-dimensional
space and how these quantities vary.  Many topics in the
physical sciences can be analysed mathematically using the techniques
of vector calculus, including fluid dynamics, solid
mechanics and electromagnetism.</p>

  <p> The book assumes no previous knowledge of vectors.  However, it is
assumed that the reader has a knowledge of basic calculus, including
differentiation, integration and partial differentiation.  Some
knowledge of linear algebra is also required, particularly the
concepts of matrices and determinants.</p>

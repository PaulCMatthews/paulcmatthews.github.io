<h1>Frequently[fn]Definition: <i>frequently </i> - at least once.[/fn]Asked Questions</h1>

  
<h3>Why do we need another book on differential equations?</h3>

  Good question. There are many good books about differential equations,
  phase planes, dynamical systems and chaos. But most of them are aimed at 
  third year or graduate level students. This is because that is the 
  stage at which this material was taught to students twenty or so years ago. 
  But these days, many university mathematics courses include
  this topic in year two, and several teach a substantial amount of it 
  in the first year. Therefore, there is a need for a book that covers 
  the essentials of this subject without including the more technical 
  and challenging aspects. 

  
<h3>What are the prerequisites for this book?</h3>

  You should be familiar with differential and integral calculus, and partial differentiation. 
  Linear algebra is also needed, especially matrices, determinants, 
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You also need to be good at sketching curves 
  and familiar with exponentials, logs and trig functions. 
  Some of these important background topics are very briefly 
  summarised in the appendix of the book.

<h3>Where are the solutions to the even-numbered exercises?</h3> 

  They are online, as supplementary electronic material. To find them, 
  first go to the springer site for the book. Scroll down the page to 
  Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises, and click on that. Then
  scroll down that page until you find 
  9.1 Supplementary electronic material, and then click on the pdf file link there.

  <h3>Why does the book do discrete systems in a non-standard way?</h3>

  In most books, discrete dynamical systems are called 'maps' 
  and are written in the form x_n+1 = f(x_n). There 
  are two things I don't like about this. Firstly, and less 
  importantly, I don't like the term 'map'. A discrete dynamical system 
  is unrelated to what the word 'map' means in plain English.
